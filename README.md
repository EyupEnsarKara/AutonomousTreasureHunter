# Autonomous Treasure Hunter

## Introduction
"Autonomous Treasure Hunter" is a 2D game developed using C# and Windows Forms. The game's core objective is to navigate an autonomous character through a randomly generated map to collect treasures. The game is designed to challenge and enhance problem-solving skills, applying object-oriented programming concepts and data structures effectively. The implementation of the A* pathfinding algorithm ensures the character can find the shortest route to collect all treasures while avoiding obstacles.

## Features
- **Dynamic Game Environment**: Randomly generated maps with treasures placed at different locations.
- **Obstacles**: Static obstacles (trees, rocks, walls, and mountains) and dynamic obstacles (birds and bees) that require strategic navigation.
- **A* Pathfinding Algorithm**: Efficient route calculation for the autonomous character to collect treasures optimally.
- **Interactive UI**: A graphical user interface that updates in real-time to show the character's progress and the dynamic environment.
- **Customizable Settings**: Different parameters of the game, like map size and obstacle density, can be adjusted.

## Installation -for develop
Just clone the repository and open the project in Visual Studio. You can run the game by building the solution and starting the application. Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed.

## Installation -for user
Just download the `AutonomousTreasureHunter.zip` file from the release section and extract it. Run the `AutonomousTreasureHunter.exe` file to start the game. Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed.

## Usage

1. **Starting the Game**: Run the application to start the game. You will see the game window with the map and the autonomous character.				
2. **Game Objective**: The objective is to collect all treasures on the map by navigating the character through obstacles.
3. **Character Movement**: The character moves autonomously using the A* pathfinding algorithm to collect treasures.
4. **Game Progress**: The game will end when all treasures are collected, and the character will return to the starting point.
5. 	**Extra Features**: You can customize speed in the game with numpad keys. 1 for slow, 2 for normal, 3 for fast and 'U' for maximum speed.
